## Running the project locally

### .env

This codebase requires the use of a `.env` file for the Contentful access keys. In the root of the codebase you will find a file called `.env.example` which contains all of the necessary information with the exception of the keys.

Once you have obtained your keys, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
